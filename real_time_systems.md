Understanding Temporal Requirements
Hard vs Soft Real-Time Systems
Hard Real-Time: Missing a deadline causes system failure
Examples in ML/AI:
├── Autonomous vehicle emergency braking
│   └── Deadline: 100ms to detect obstacle and engage brakes
├── Industrial robot control
│   └── Deadline: 1ms for position updates to prevent collision
├── Medical device monitoring
│   └── Deadline: 50ms to detect cardiac arrhythmia
└── Trading systems
    └── Deadline: 10μs to process market data and place orders

Consequence of missing deadline: Catastrophic failure
Requirements: 100% guarantee of meeting deadlines
Soft Real-Time: Missing deadlines degrades performance but doesn't cause failure
Examples in ML/AI:
├── Video game AI opponents
│   └── Target: 16ms (60 FPS), occasional misses acceptable
├── Voice assistants
│   └── Target: 200ms response time, delays are annoying but not critical
├── Recommendation systems
│   └── Target: 100ms, slower responses hurt user experience
└── Interactive chat applications
    └── Target: 500ms, delays reduce engagement

Consequence of missing deadline: Performance degradation
Requirements: Statistical guarantees (e.g., 99.9% of deadlines met)

Latency requirements: Achieving ultra low response 20:01:16
