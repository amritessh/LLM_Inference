Fault Tolerance - Goes beyond simple error handling to include sophisticated redundancy strategies (active-active ensembles, voting systems), graceful degradation under load, and circuit breaker patterns that prevent cascading failures. The examples show how to build systems that continue operating even when individual components fail.
High Availability - Understanding that 99.9% vs 99.99% availability represents the difference between 8.76 hours vs 52.56 minutes of downtime per year - massive operational implications. The multi-region disaster recovery system demonstrates enterprise-grade approaches to maintaining service continuity.
Safety Critical Systems - The most stringent requirements where failures can cause harm or loss of life. The Safety Integrity Level (SIL) implementation shows how to build systems meeting regulatory standards for autonomous vehicles, medical devices, and other safety-critical applications.

The most critical insight: These three concepts build on each other hierarchically. You need fault tolerance for high availability, and you need both for safety-critical operation. A system can be fault-tolerant but not highly available (planned downtime), or highly available but not safety-critical (acceptable degraded operation).
Real-world applications:

Autonomous vehicles: SIL-4 requirements, triple modular redundancy, fail-safe behavior
Financial trading: 99.99% availability, sub-millisecond failover, regulatory compliance
Medical devices: Formal verification, comprehensive audit trails, patient safety guarantees
Cloud services: Multi-region redundancy, automated disaster recovery, service level agreements

The comprehensive validation framework at the end shows how to systematically verify that these reliability measures actually work under real-world conditions.
Would you like me to dive deeper into any specific reliability pattern, or perhaps show how to implement these concepts for a particular domain like healthcare or autonomous systems?RetryClaude can make mistakes. Please double-check responses.
